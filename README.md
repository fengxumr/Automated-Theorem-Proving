# Automated-Theorem-Proving
In 1958 the logician Hao Wang implemented one of the first automated theorem provers. He succeeded in writing several programs capable of automatically proving a majority of theorems from the first five chapters of Whitehead and Russell’s Principia Mathematica (in fact, his program managed to prove over 200 of these theorems “within about 37 minutes, and 12/13 of the time is used for read-in and print-out”). This was an impressive achievement at the time; previous attempts had only succeeded in proving a handful of the theorems in Principia Mathematica.
